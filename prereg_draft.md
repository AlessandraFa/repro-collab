## Study Overview

> “The tower of Babel was never finished because the workers could not reach an understanding on how they should build it; my psychophysical edifice will stand because the workers will never agree on how to tear it down.”  
> — Fechner (1877)

In this quote, Fechner (1877) proposes that his psychophysical framework will paradoxically endure because (the many) critics cannot agree on how to disprove it. 
One core principal of psychophysics is Stevens' Power Law, which proposes that for many physical stimuli, the relationship between the actual intensity of the stimuli and the perceived intensity of the sensation is non-linear. 

In this study, we aim to replicate part of the original study from Stevens (1957) that applies this law to size perception. 
The law describes the relationship between the perceived size of an object and its physical size using the following formula: 

**P = k × Iⁿ**

where  
- *P* is the perceived size,  
- *I* is the physical size,  
- *k* is a constant, and  
- *n* is an exponent that defines the curve of the relationship.

## Hypotheses

We hypothesize that perceived size will follow a power function with an exponent different from 1.

## Methods

Participants will compare squares of varying sizes using a tachistoscope, which presents stimuli for controlled durations. 
In each trial, a comparison stimulus  (a square of variable size) will be presented alongside a reference stimulus (a fixed square). 
Participants will judge whether the comparison stimulus appears larger or smaller than the reference.

A total of 39 different comparison stimuli will be used, ranging in area from 8.00 sq.mm to 15.00 sq.mm. 
Stimuli will be presented in random order. 
Each participant will provide 200 judgements for all stimulus difference close to equality, 100 for stimulus differences of intermediate value, and 50 for the largest values of stimulus difference.
Experimental sessions will last one hour, during which approximately 200 judgements will be obtained.
Each participant will provide approximately 6,850 judgements.

Participants will be instructed to respond as quickly as possible once they are confident in their judgment, but stimuli will remain visible until a decision is made. 
Reaction times will be recorded using a Miller time circuit. 

## Sample Size

Data will be collected from five participants with normal vision and without glasses.

## Analysis Plan

The data will be plotted individually for each participant, focusing on the stimulus pairs with the largest differences. 
On the y-axis, the median discrimination time (in seconds) will be plotted and on the x-axis, the stimulus difference (in sq.mm). 
Visual inspection will be used to assess whether the data can be approximated by two straight lines: a horizontal line for small stimulus differences and a negative slope for larger differences.
