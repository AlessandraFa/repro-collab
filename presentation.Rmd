Happy collaborations:

* don't fight with technology, they take advantage of it
* don't engage in edit wars, they have clear responsibilities

--

This is as much as a **technological** challange, as a **sociological** one.

Speaking of technology, why can't we use good old:

* Word
* Google Docs / Overleaf
* Google Collab
* Dropbox / Seafile etc.

---

# Word

.pull-left[

## Upside

* everyone can use it
* track changes

]

.pull-right[

## Downside

* only one person at any given time
* no reproducibility

---

# Google Doc / Overleaf

.pull-left[

## Upside

* everyone can use it
* many people
* ~~track changes~~

]

.pull-right[

## Downside

* anyone can edit everything, without anyone noticing
* no reproducibility

]

---

# Google Collab

.pull-left[

## Upside

* many people can edit
* track changes via GitHub
* reproducibility

.pull-right[

## Downside

* track changes via GitHub

# Dropbox & Co

# GitHub / GitLab

.pull-left[

## Upside

* reproducibility
* high level of control
