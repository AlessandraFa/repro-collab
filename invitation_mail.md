Subject: Getting Ready for the Workshop on Reproducible Research in Collaboration

Dear participants,

Thank you for signing up for our workshop "Reproducible Research in Collaboration: Writing Academic Texts on GitHub Together", which will take place this Thursday at 9 AM.

While we’re finalizing the materials, please create a GitHub account if you don’t already have one. You can sign up here: https://github.com/signup.

Creating an account is quick and easy. Yet, since we hope to convince you to use GitHub regularly from now on, you might want to make sure to choose a username you’ll still like later. If you’d like some advice, you can find tips like “Pick a username you’ll be comfortable revealing to your future boss” here: https://happygitwithr.com/github-acct. 

No other preparation is needed — just bring your laptop to the workshop.

We’re looking forward to seeing you at the workshop!
Aaron & Hannes
